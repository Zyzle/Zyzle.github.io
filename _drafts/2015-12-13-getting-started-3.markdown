In parts [1]({% post_url 2015-12-05-getting-started-part-1 %}) and [2]({% post_url 2015-12-12-getting-started-2 %}) of this tutorial we looked at getting started with the Jekyll tool and at how the Liquid template engine renders our content. If you've been following the tutorial up until now you should have a basic blog that looks similar to the following:

![default look blog](/images/drafts/default-look.png)

This is fine for getting up and running with the framework but looks a little dull.
